This is a bot that detects reddit comments shorter than 30 characters with the phrase "is it friday yet".

It then responds with "Yes, it is Friday" or "No, it is not Friday yet, it is ____." It also offers words of encouragement to the commenter to get them through the week.

 I am hosting it on Heroku and it runs constantly, scanning comments from r/all.
 
 This uses PRAW to interact with the reddit API.
 
 It began running 10/13/18.
 
 As of 10/13/18, it has been running for 2 hours and has successfully detected and replied to 2 comments.
